# Contributing to awesome-twine

Please contribute. Even if it's just a small engine you wrote as a one-off, every contribution to the Twine ecosystem helps it grow bigger and better. 

## Adding a resource

Fork this repo and [open a PR](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github). If you haven't used Github before, here's a [detailed tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

When you add a resource, please link to the most authoritative source possible. Sometimes that may only be a snippet in gist, but if there's an official website use that and if need be then link to a repository.

Please generally keep each PR small and fill out the PR template as best as you can.

## Guidelines

+ Outside of Compilers and Official Engines, please prefer alphabetical sorting.
+ Write a small helpful blurb for the link. Try to align with how the project describes itself.
+ The link name should be the name of the resource
+ Try to avoid adding new categories unless you really need to! There are a few categories commented out since they have no entries - feel free to uncomment these and fill them in.
